**Background**

When I was creating a clone iOS Calculator, I realized that there were many rules about calculating.  
But to iOS beginner like me, it may be even hard work to implement UI. 

This is why I've made this library. I hope you to enjoy just implementing user interface, because making beautiful UI is worth for itself!
